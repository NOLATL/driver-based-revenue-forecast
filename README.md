# Driver-Based Revenue Forecasting with Statistical & Machine Learning Models

**Business-ready forecasting framework leveraging historical revenue data and macroeconomic indicators to improve planning accuracy for mid-market, private equity-backed companies.**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Executive Overview
This project demonstrates a structured approach to **monthly revenue forecasting**, starting with statistical baselines, adding macroeconomic drivers, and comparing manual machine learning models against AutoML-selected approaches.

The goal is to help finance and operations leaders make **better-informed budgeting, staffing, and capital allocation decisions** by improving forecast accuracy and interpretability.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Context & Value
For mid-market, PE-backed businesses with $50â€“150M in annual revenue, accurate forecasts can:
- Improve **cash flow management** and debt servicing.
- Align **budgeting** and **resource planning** with realistic revenue expectations.
- Enable **scenario analysis** to prepare for both market headwinds and growth opportunities.

This framework:
- Benchmarks multiple modeling approaches (statistical & ML).
- Highlights when **simpler statistical models** may outperform complex ML.
- Demonstrates the role of **AutoML** in finding optimal models and hyperparameters.

## ðŸ›  Approach

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load & clean historical financial data.
   - Load, align, and prepare macroeconomic indicators from FRED.
   - Merge datasets and engineer time series features.

2. **Modeling Stages**
   - **Statistical Baselines** â€“ ARIMA, SARIMAX (financial data only).
   - **Machine Learning Baseline** â€“ Gradient Boosted Trees with feature engineering.
   - **AutoML** â€“ PyCaret to test multiple models with optimized hyperparameters.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: MAPE, MAE, RMSE, RÂ².
   - Business interpretation of each metric.
   - Selection based on lowest MAPE and stable performance.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results
| Model        | MAPE   | MAE       | RMSE      | RÂ²     |
|--------------|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| PyCaret stlf | 0.81%  | 79,891    | 94,662    | 0.709  |
| SARIMAX      | 2.60%  | 252,857   | 468,868   | 0.067  |
| GBT          | 3.12%  | 313,418   | 406,035   | 0.497  |
| ARIMA        | 6.85%  | 708,584   | 767,430   | -2.071 |

**Business Takeaway:**  
- SARIMAX provided a highly reliable forecast using only historical revenue trends.
- GBT added some value over ARIMA but did not surpass SARIMAX.
- PyCaretâ€™s STLForecaster delivered the best performance, showing the potential of AutoML for complex searches and fine-tuning.
